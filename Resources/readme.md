# Physical Computing Remote Learning Tools

Here are some tools for sharing circuits, code, and fabrication techniques with your classmates and instructors when you can't be physically in the same place together. 

These have been collected from a number of sources. Thanks especially to the tangible tactics group, a loose collection of faculty and staff from  Ryerson University, OCADU, Sheridan College, NYU, and others.  

## Video Tools

How to share your circuits live via Video

## Text Tools

[codeshare.io](https://codeshare.io/) A shared code editing site. It's very barebones, but it's fast and easy to get set up and edit together in real time. 

Visual Studio Code liveshare plugin

[github]() - Github is the most common code management platform used at ITP. It's very useful for managing code and circuit drawing versioning among a group. You're probably using it right now, if you're reading this. 

## Drawing Tools

When drawing circuits, using common [electronic schematic symbols] and sharing your drawings in editable formats like SVG (scalable vector graphics) makes it easier to share materials. Many beginners find schematics abstract at first, so breadboard-friendly drawing programs are handy as well.

[mural.co](https://www.mural.co/) A shared drawing board. There are many others available, but this one is particularly useful because it supports SVG import, meaning you can import parts that you export from other circuit drawing programs like Fritzing or Eagle. It also has a library of standard electrical schematic symbols, making it easy to share circuit drawing exercises in real time.

[Fritzing]() is a circuit and schematic drawing program designed for electronics beginners. It supports drawing in breadboard view, schematic view, or printed circuit board (PCB) view. It can export many different image formats, and can be extended by making your own parts files. Many suppliers of hobbyist elextrinics parts make  of their parts available as Fritzing files, including [Sparkfun]() and [Adafruit](), and others.  Though it's no longer free, the work is self-financed by the maintainer, so the proce is a good deal, 

Inkscape is a free and open source vector drawing tool.

[Affinity Designer]() is a vector drawing tool similar to [Adobe Illustrator](), but less expensive with most of the same features. 
 [Sketch]() is another popular vector drawing tool among graphic designers.
