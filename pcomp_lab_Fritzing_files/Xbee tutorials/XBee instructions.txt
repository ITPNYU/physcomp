XBee Lab:

Each group will build two physical devices:
	* The first  will listen for serial input. 
		- When the device receives its group number (ASCII-encoded) in the serial input (which is attached to its XBee radio), the device will generate a physical output. It will also echo the serial input to its serial output.

		- All other incoming serial messages will be ignored.
	
	* The second device will read the physical output from the first through an appropriate input sensor.  
		When it receives an input, it will send (group number + 1) out the serial output to its XBee radio. 

Each group will have two XBee radios, one on the input device and one on the output device.
	
Radios will be configured as follows:
	* Radio on the first device: 
		* my address = group number + (group number -1)
		* destination address = 0
	* Radio on on the second device: 
		* my address: (group number-1) * 2
		* destination address: group number * 2

Teachers will build a device that can receive from every group, and send to any chosen group:
	* Arduino attached to an XBee Radio, configured as follows:
		* my address: 0
		* transmit address: FF
	* Arduino will have one pushbutton for every group in the class
	* If an ASCII-encoded number is received in the serial port, the Arduino will display the number visibly
	* If a group's pushbutton is pressed, the Arduino will send that group's number serially to the XBee radio.
